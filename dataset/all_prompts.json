BasicService provides a default implementation for the methods defined in the Service interface, and defines a set of helper methods that allow the APDU buffer to enable cooperation among different services.\nRMI Classes for the Java Card Platform\nThe CardRemoteObject and RMIService classes allow a Java programming language program running on a virtual machine on the client platform to invoke methods on remote objects in a Java Card technology-based applet. These classes contain the minimum required functionality to implement Remote Method Invocation for the Java Card platform (RMI for the Java Card  platform).\n "}, {"prompt": "State the significance of the `UtilException` exception in the `javacardx.framework.util` package.", "completion": "`UtilException` represents a util related exception.\n\nThe API classes throw Java Card runtime environment-owned instances of `UtilException`.\n\nJava Card runtime environment-owned instances of exception classes are temporary Java Card runtime environment Entry Point Objects and can be accessed from any applet context.

The format of the APDU is defined in ISO specification 7816-4.\n\nThis class only supports messages which conform to the structure of command and response defined in ISO 7816-4. The behavior of messages which use proprietary structure of messages is undefined. This class optionally supports extended length fields but only when the currently selected applet implements the `javacardx.apdu.ExtendedLength` interface.\n\nThe `APDU` object is owned by the Java Card runtime environment. The `APDU` class maintains a byte array buffer which is used to transfer incoming APDU header and data bytes as well as outgoing data. The buffer length must be at least 133 bytes ( 5 bytes of header and 128 bytes of data ). The Java Card runtime environment must zero out the APDU buffer before each new message received from the CAD.\n\nThe Java Card runtime environment designates the `APDU` object as a temporary Java Card runtime environment Entry Point Object (See Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card Platform, Classic Edition, section 6.2.1 for details). A temporary Java Card runtime environment Entry Point Object can be accessed from any applet context. References to these temporary objects cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.\n\nThe Java Card runtime environment similarly marks the APDU buffer as a global array (See Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card Platform, Classic Edition, section 6.2.2 for details). A global array can be accessed from any applet context. References to global arrays cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.\n\nThe applet receives the `APDU` instance to process from the Java Card runtime environment in the `Applet.process(APDU)` method, and the first five header bytes [ CLA, INS, P1, P2, P3 ] are available in the APDU buffer. (The header format is the ISO7816-4 defined 7 byte extended APDU format with a 3 byte Lc field when the Lc field in the incoming APDU header is 3 bytes long).\n\nThe `APDU` class API is designed to be transport protocol independent. In other words, applets can use the same APDU methods regardless of whether the underlying protocol in use is T=0 or T=1 (as defined in ISO 7816-3).\n\nThe incoming APDU data size may be bigger than the APDU buffer size and may therefore need to be read in portions by the applet. Similarly, the outgoing response APDU data size may be bigger than the APDU buffer size and may need to be written in portions by the applet. The `APDU` class has methods to facilitate this.\n\nFor sending large byte arrays as response data, the `APDU` class provides a special method `sendBytesLong()` which manages the APDU buffer.\n\n\n```\n// The purpose of this example is to show most of the methods\n // in use and not to depict any particular APDU processing\n \n class MyApplet extends javacard.framework.Applet {\n // ...\n public void process(APDU apdu){\n // ...\n byte[] buffer = apdu.getBuffer();\n byte cla = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_CLA];\n byte ins = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_INS];\n ...\n // assume this command has incoming data\n // Lc tells us the incoming apdu command length\n short bytesLeft = (short) (buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_LC] & 0x00FF);\n if (bytesLeft < (short)55) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n \n short readCount = apdu.setIncomingAndReceive();\n while ( bytesLeft > 0){\n // enter code here to process the data previously read in buffer[5]\n // to buffer[readCount+4];\n bytesLeft -= readCount;\n readCount = apdu.receiveBytes ( ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA ); // read more APDU data\n }\n //\n //...\n //\n // Note that for a short response as in the case illustrated here\n // the three APDU method calls shown : setOutgoing(),setOutgoingLength() & sendBytes()\n // could be replaced by one APDU method call : setOutgoingAndSend().\n \n // construct the reply APDU\n short le = apdu.setOutgoing();\n if (le < (short)2) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n apdu.setOutgoingLength( (short)3 );\n \n // build response data in apdu.buffer[ 0.. outCount-1 ];\n buffer[0] = (byte)1; buffer[1] = (byte)2; buffer[3] = (byte)3;\n apdu.sendBytes ( (short)0 , (short)3 );\n // return good complete status 90 00\n }\n // ...\n }\n```\nThe `APDU` class also defines a set of `STATE_..` constants which represent the various processing states of the `APDU` object based on the methods invoked and the state of the data transfers. The `getCurrentState()` method returns the current state.\n\nNote that the state number assignments are ordered as follows: STATE_INITIAL < STATE_PARTIAL_INCOMING < STATE_FULL_INCOMING < STATE_OUTGOING < STATE_OUTGOING_LENGTH_KNOWN < STATE_PARTIAL_OUTGOING < STATE_FULL_OUTGOING.\n\nThe following are processing error states and have negative state number assignments : STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_GETRESPONSE, STATE_ERROR_T1_IFD_ABORT, STATE_ERROR_IO and STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_REISSUE.\n\nNote:\n- The method descriptions use the ISO7816-4 notation for the various APDU I/O cases of input and output directions. For example - T=0 (Case 2S) protocol - refers to short length outbound only case using the T=0 protocol. The perspective of the notation used in the method descriptions is that of the card(ICC) as seen at the transport layer(TPDU). External transformations of the APDU I/O case may have occurred at the CAD and therefore not visible to the card.\n- The method descriptions mention T=0 and T=1 protocols.

The comparison is based on the UTF-8-encoded Unicode value of each character in the strings.

The result is a negative number if the character sequence contained in `aString` lexicographically precedes the character sequence contained in `anotherString`. The result is a positive number if the character sequence contained in `aString` lexicographically follows the character sequence contained in `anotherString`.

If they have different characters at one or more index positions, letkbe the smallest such index; then the string whose character at positionkhas the smaller value, as determined by using the < operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, `compare` returns the difference of the first mismatching byte of the UTF-8 encode representation of the two character at positionkin the two strings.

The format of the APDU is defined in ISO specification 7816-4.\n\nThis class only supports messages which conform to the structure of command and response defined in ISO 7816-4. The behavior of messages which use proprietary structure of messages is undefined. This class optionally supports extended length fields but only when the currently selected applet implements the `javacardx.apdu.ExtendedLength` interface.\n\nThe `APDU` object is owned by the Java Card runtime environment. The `APDU` class maintains a byte array buffer which is used to transfer incoming APDU header and data bytes as well as outgoing data. The buffer length must be at least 133 bytes ( 5 bytes of header and 128 bytes of data ). The Java Card runtime environment must zero out the APDU buffer before each new message received from the CAD.\n\nThe Java Card runtime environment designates the `APDU` object as a temporary Java Card runtime environment Entry Point Object (See Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card Platform, Classic Edition, section 6.2.1 for details). A temporary Java Card runtime environment Entry Point Object can be accessed from any applet context. References to these temporary objects cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.\n\nThe Java Card runtime environment similarly marks the APDU buffer as a global array (See Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card Platform, Classic Edition, section 6.2.2 for details). A global array can be accessed from any applet context. References to global arrays cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.\n\nThe applet receives the `APDU` instance to process from the Java Card runtime environment in the `Applet.process(APDU)` method, and the first five header bytes [ CLA, INS, P1, P2, P3 ] are available in the APDU buffer. (The header format is the ISO7816-4 defined 7 byte extended APDU format with a 3 byte Lc field when the Lc field in the incoming APDU header is 3 bytes long).\n\nThe `APDU` class API is designed to be transport protocol independent. In other words, applets can use the same APDU methods regardless of whether the underlying protocol in use is T=0 or T=1 (as defined in ISO 7816-3).\n\nThe incoming APDU data size may be bigger than the APDU buffer size and may therefore need to be read in portions by the applet. Similarly, the outgoing response APDU data size may be bigger than the APDU buffer size and may need to be written in portions by the applet. The `APDU` class has methods to facilitate this.\n\nFor sending large byte arrays as response data, the `APDU` class provides a special method `sendBytesLong()` which manages the APDU buffer.\n\n\n```\n// The purpose of this example is to show most of the methods\n // in use and not to depict any particular APDU processing\n \n class MyApplet extends javacard.framework.Applet {\n // ...\n public void process(APDU apdu){\n // ...\n byte[] buffer = apdu.getBuffer();\n byte cla = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_CLA];\n byte ins = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_INS];\n ...\n // assume this command has incoming data\n // Lc tells us the incoming apdu command length\n short bytesLeft = (short) (buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_LC] & 0x00FF);\n if (bytesLeft < (short)55) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n \n short readCount = apdu.setIncomingAndReceive();\n while ( bytesLeft > 0){\n // enter code here to process the data previously read in buffer[5]\n // to buffer[readCount+4];\n bytesLeft -= readCount;\n readCount = apdu.receiveBytes ( ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA ); // read more APDU data\n }\n //\n //...\n //\n // Note that for a short response as in the case illustrated here\n // the three APDU method calls shown : setOutgoing(),setOutgoingLength() & sendBytes()\n // could be replaced by one APDU method call : setOutgoingAndSend().\n \n // construct the reply APDU\n short le = apdu.setOutgoing();\n if (le < (short)2) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n apdu.setOutgoingLength( (short)3 );\n \n // build response data in apdu.buffer[ 0.. outCount-1 ];\n buffer[0] = (byte)1; buffer[1] = (byte)2; buffer[3] = (byte)3;\n apdu.sendBytes ( (short)0 , (short)3 );\n // return good complete status 90 00\n }\n // ...\n }\n```\nThe `APDU` class also defines a set of `STATE_..` constants which represent the various processing states of the `APDU` object based on the methods invoked and the state of the data transfers. The `getCurrentState()` method returns the current state.\n\nNote that the state number assignments are ordered as follows: STATE_INITIAL < STATE_PARTIAL_INCOMING < STATE_FULL_INCOMING < STATE_OUTGOING < STATE_OUTGOING_LENGTH_KNOWN < STATE_PARTIAL_OUTGOING < STATE_FULL_OUTGOING.\n\nThe following are processing error states and have negative state number assignments : STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_GETRESPONSE, STATE_ERROR_T1_IFD_ABORT, STATE_ERROR_IO and STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_REISSUE.\n\nNote:\n- The method descriptions use the ISO7816-4 notation for the various APDU I/O cases of input and output directions. For example - T=0 (Case 2S) protocol - refers to short length outbound only case using the T=0 protocol. The perspective of the notation used in the method descriptions is that of the card(ICC) as seen at the transport layer(TPDU). External transformations of the APDU I/O case may have occurred at the CAD and therefore not visible to the card.\n- The method descriptions mention T=0 and T=1 protocols. Unless specifically called out, the behavior described for T=1 protocol is applicable to contactless protocols also."}, {"prompt": "What does the `isChannelSecure(byte)` method of the `SecurityService` interface in the `javacard.framework.service` package serve to accomplish?", "completion": "Checks whether a secure channel is established between the card and the host for the ongoing session that guarantees the indicated properties.\n\nReturns: true if the required properties are true, false otherwise\n\nThrows:\n- `ServiceException` - with the following reason code:\n- `ServiceException.ILLEGAL_PARAM` if the specified property is unknown."}, {"prompt": "What is the function of the `match(byte[], short, short)` method of the `BioMatcher` interface in the `javacardx.biometry1toN` package?", "completion": "Continues a biometric matching session.

Additionally, any local variable holding a reference to a `OneShot` instance should be set to `null` once the instance is closed in order to prevent further use attempts.\n- Upon return from any `Applet` entry point method, back to the JCRE, and on tear or card reset events any `OneShot` instances in use are released back to the JCRE.\n- The internal state associated with an instance of `OneShot` must be bound to the initial calling context (owner context) as to preclude use/calls on that instance from other contexts.\n- Unless otherwise specified, after an instance of `OneShot` is released back to the JCRE, calls to any of the instance methods of the `OneShot` class results in an `CryptoException` being thrown with reason code `CryptoException.ILLEGAL_USE`.\n\nThe following code shows a typical usage pattern for the `OneShot` class.\n```...\n RandomData.OneShot rng = null;\n try {\n rng = RandomData.OneShot.open(RandomData.ALG_TRNG);\n rng.nextBytes(rndData, (short) 0, (short) rndData.length);\n } catch (CryptoException ce) {\n // Handle exception\n } finally {\n if (rng != null) {\n rng.close();\n rng = null;\n }\n }\n ...\n```"}, {"prompt": "What is the `makeTransientShortArray(short, byte)` method of the `JCSystem` class in the `javacard.framework` package intended for?", "completion": "Creates a transient short array with the specified array length.\n\nReturns: the new transient short array\n\nThrows:\n- `NegativeArraySizeException` - if the `length` parameter is negative\n- `SystemException` - with the following reason codes:\n- `SystemException.ILLEGAL_VALUE` if event is not a valid event code.\n- `SystemException.NO_TRANSIENT_SPACE` if sufficient transient space is not available.\n- `SystemException.ILLEGAL_TRANSIENT` if the current applet context is not the currently selected applet context and `CLEAR_ON_DESELECT` is specified."}, {"prompt": "What is the `getPartialBytes(short, byte[], short, byte)` method of the `AID` class in the `javacard.framework` package intended for?", "completion": "Called to get part of the AID bytes encapsulated within the `AID` object starting at the specified offset for the specified length.\n\nReturns: the actual length of the bytes returned in `dest`\n\nThrows:\n- `SecurityException` - if the `dest` array is not accessible in the caller's context\n- `NullPointerException` - if the `dest` parameter is `null`\n- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the `aidOffset` parameter is negative or greater than the length of the encapsulated AID bytes or the `oOffset` parameter is negative or `oOffset+length` of bytes requested is greater than the length of the `dest` array"}, {"prompt": "What is the `SIG_CIPHER_DES_MAC4` field of the `Signature` class in the `javacard.security` package used for?", "completion": "Cipher algorithm `SIG_CIPHER_DES_MAC4` choice for the `cipherAlgorithm` parameter of the `getInstance(byte, byte, byte, boolean)` method.

The `APDU` class has methods to facilitate this.\n\nFor sending large byte arrays as response data, the `APDU` class provides a special method `sendBytesLong()` which manages the APDU buffer.\n\n\n```\n// The purpose of this example is to show most of the methods\n // in use and not to depict any particular APDU processing\n \n class MyApplet extends javacard.framework.Applet {\n // ...\n public void process(APDU apdu){\n // ...\n byte[] buffer = apdu.getBuffer();\n byte cla = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_CLA];\n byte ins = buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_INS];\n ...\n // assume this command has incoming data\n // Lc tells us the incoming apdu command length\n short bytesLeft = (short) (buffer[ISO7816.OFFSET_LC] & 0x00FF);\n if (bytesLeft < (short)55) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n \n short readCount = apdu.setIncomingAndReceive();\n while ( bytesLeft > 0){\n // enter code here to process the data previously read in buffer[5]\n // to buffer[readCount+4];\n bytesLeft -= readCount;\n readCount = apdu.receiveBytes ( ISO7816.OFFSET_CDATA ); // read more APDU data\n }\n //\n //...\n //\n // Note that for a short response as in the case illustrated here\n // the three APDU method calls shown : setOutgoing(),setOutgoingLength() & sendBytes()\n // could be replaced by one APDU method call : setOutgoingAndSend().\n \n // construct the reply APDU\n short le = apdu.setOutgoing();\n if (le < (short)2) ISOException.throwIt( ISO7816.SW_WRONG_LENGTH );\n apdu.setOutgoingLength( (short)3 );\n \n // build response data in apdu.buffer[ 0.. outCount-1 ];\n buffer[0] = (byte)1; buffer[1] = (byte)2; buffer[3] = (byte)3;\n apdu.sendBytes ( (short)0 , (short)3 );\n // return good complete status 90 00\n }\n // ...\n }\n```\nThe `APDU` class also defines a set of `STATE_..` constants which represent the various processing states of the `APDU` object based on the methods invoked and the state of the data transfers. The `getCurrentState()` method returns the current state.\n\nNote that the state number assignments are ordered as follows: STATE_INITIAL < STATE_PARTIAL_INCOMING < STATE_FULL_INCOMING < STATE_OUTGOING < STATE_OUTGOING_LENGTH_KNOWN < STATE_PARTIAL_OUTGOING < STATE_FULL_OUTGOING.\n\nThe following are processing error states and have negative state number assignments : STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_GETRESPONSE, STATE_ERROR_T1_IFD_ABORT, STATE_ERROR_IO and STATE_ERROR_NO_T0_REISSUE.\n\nNote:\n- The method descriptions use the ISO7816-4 notation for the various APDU I/O cases of input and output directions. For example - T=0 (Case 2S) protocol - refers to short length outbound only case using the T=0 protocol. The perspective of the notation used in the method descriptions is that of the card(ICC) as seen at the transport layer(TPDU). External transformations of the APDU I/O case may have occurred at the CAD and therefore not visible to the card.\n- The method descriptions mention T=0 and T=1 protocols.

An implementation must throw a `StringException` with reason `StringException.UNSUPPORTED_ENCODING` if a requested character encoding is not supported.\n\nUTF-8 encodes each of the code points in the Unicode character set using one to four 8-bit bytes. Unicode code points are the numerical values that make up the Unicode code space. The Unicode Standard, version 4.0 is available from the Unicode Consortium athttp://www.unicode.org. The UTF-8 transformation format is specified byRFC 3629.\n\nThe encoded character sequences handled by this class are stored in byte arrays. Each string or character sequence is designated by a byte array, an offset in the byte array indicating the start of the character sequence and a length indicating the length in bytes of the character sequence. If a designated character sequence is outside the bounds of its containing array an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown (note: for readablity reasons, these exceptions are assumed and not systematically documented in the methods of this class).\nAn index of a character or substring within a string is always relative to the begining of the string; that is relative to the offset of the string within the containing byte array. If a provided index of a character or substring within a designated character sequence is outside the bounds of the designated character sequence an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.\n\nThis class provides two categories of methods:Methods for dealing with plain byte sequencesThese methods do not check the (UTF-8) well-formedness of the byte sequences passed as parameters; in particular, they do not check whether the byte at a provided offset is the first byte of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence or if a provided length is equal or greater than the length of the UTF-8 byte sequence starting at the provided offset (as can be determined by its first byte). They only treat UTF-8 byte sequences as plain byte sequences for the purpose of comparison, copying, truncating... As an example of such methods, see the `indexOf` method.Methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., Unicode characters)These methods check the well-formedness of UTF-8 byte sequences. They either throw a `StringException` with reason `StringException.INVALID_BYTE_SEQUENCE` when encountering an ill-formed UTF-8 byte sequence; as an example of such methods, see the `convertTo` method.\nOr they consider any byte sequence that is not well-formed (eg. incomplete) within a designated text range as a code point for the purpose of counting, comparing or returning; as an example of such methods, see the `codePointCount` method.To ensure that a character or character sequence is a valid UTF-8 character or character sequence, the `check` method should be used.\n\nBecause Unicode case conversion may require locale-sensitive mappings, context-sensitive mappings, and 1:M character mappings, and in order to limit footprint case conversion supported by the methods `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase` and `compare` is only available by default for the Basic Latin Unicode block (US-ASCII character set: U+0000 - U+007F).

An implementation must throw a `StringException` with reason `StringException.UNSUPPORTED_ENCODING` if a requested character encoding is not supported.\n\nUTF-8 encodes each of the code points in the Unicode character set using one to four 8-bit bytes. Unicode code points are the numerical values that make up the Unicode code space. The Unicode Standard, version 4.0 is available from the Unicode Consortium athttp://www.unicode.org. The UTF-8 transformation format is specified byRFC 3629.\n\nThe encoded character sequences handled by this class are stored in byte arrays. Each string or character sequence is designated by a byte array, an offset in the byte array indicating the start of the character sequence and a length indicating the length in bytes of the character sequence. If a designated character sequence is outside the bounds of its containing array an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown (note: for readablity reasons, these exceptions are assumed and not systematically documented in the methods of this class).\nAn index of a character or substring within a string is always relative to the begining of the string; that is relative to the offset of the string within the containing byte array. If a provided index of a character or substring within a designated character sequence is outside the bounds of the designated character sequence an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.\n\nThis class provides two categories of methods:Methods for dealing with plain byte sequencesThese methods do not check the (UTF-8) well-formedness of the byte sequences passed as parameters; in particular, they do not check whether the byte at a provided offset is the first byte of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence or if a provided length is equal or greater than the length of the UTF-8 byte sequence starting at the provided offset (as can be determined by its first byte). They only treat UTF-8 byte sequences as plain byte sequences for the purpose of comparison, copying, truncating... As an example of such methods, see the `indexOf` method.Methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., Unicode characters)These methods check the well-formedness of UTF-8 byte sequences. They either throw a `StringException` with reason `StringException.INVALID_BYTE_SEQUENCE` when encountering an ill-formed UTF-8 byte sequence; as an example of such methods, see the `convertTo` method.\nOr they consider any byte sequence that is not well-formed (eg. incomplete) within a designated text range as a code point for the purpose of counting, comparing or returning; as an example of such methods, see the `codePointCount` method.To ensure that a character or character sequence is a valid UTF-8 character or character sequence, the `check` method should be used.\n\nBecause Unicode case conversion may require locale-sensitive mappings, context-sensitive mappings, and 1:M character mappings, and in order to limit footprint case conversion supported by the methods `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase` and `compare` is only available by default for the Basic Latin Unicode block (US-ASCII character set: U+0000 - U+007F).
